\section{Teamwork}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item There are N workers, indexed by $i=1,..,N$
    \item Each worker can exert effort $e_i$ at cost $c_i(e_i)=e_i^2/2$
    \item Output is the sum of everyone's effort: $y(e)=\sum_{i=1}^N e_i$
    \item The firm can pay a wage to each worker based only on team output $w_i(y(e))$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the first-best effort for each worker (the amount of effort which maximizes total surplus).

\vspace{7cm}


\item[***] Consider a wage scheme $w_i(y(e)), ...,w_N(y(e))$ that is a partnership (see the definition from class). You may assume that the wage is differentiable.

    
    \item  Setup the worker's utility maximization problem. Also write down the budget-balance condition for partnerships.

\vspace{7cm}

    
    \item Find and simplify the worker's effort first-order condition.

   \vspace{7cm}
   

    
\item Use your answers from (1) and (3) and the fact that in partnerships all money must be paid out to prove that we cannot get first-best effort.


\vspace{7cm}

\vspace{7cm}
    

\item[***] Consider a wage scheme  $w_1(y(e)),...., w_N(y(e))$ that is a group bonus (see the definition from class) where the target is total first-best effort $\bar y = \sum_{i=1}^N e_i^{FB}$ and the bonus amount is more than the effort cost $b_i\geq c_i(e_i^{FB})$.

    \item Argue that each worker does not want to exert too little effort ($e_i<e_i^{FB}$).

\vspace{6cm}

    \item Argue that each worker does not want to exert too much effort ($e_i>e_i^{FB}$).

\vspace{6cm}

    \item Find a group bonus that gives everyone the same bonus $b_i=b$ and that achieves first-best effort.

\vspace{7cm}


 \item Give an example of an organization that might have trouble committing to a group bonus, and explain why.

\vspace{6cm}

\section{Relational Contracts}
\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A firm and a worker both have discount rate $\delta$ and interact for many periods ($t=1,...,\infty$)
    \item At each period $t$ the following occur:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First the firm offers a flat wage $w_t$
        \item Second the worker chooses high (H) or low (L) effort $e_t$
    \end{itemize}
    \item High effort has cost $c>0$, low effort has cost 0.
    \item High effort yields revenue $v$, low effort yields revenue 0.
    \item Firm outside option is 0, worker outside option is $\bar u>0$.
    \item Assume the firm wants to motivate high effort.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Guess an equilibrium strategy for the firm in words. Guess an equilibrium strategy for the worker in words. (Hint: guess the same strategy as in class)

  \vspace{6cm}  
  

    \item Call the high wage $w_H$ and the low wage $w_L$. Assume the strategy you guessed is being played. What value of $w_L$ will the firm choose? What is the worker's payoff in any period where the firm posts a wage of $w_L$? Justify your answers.

  \vspace{6cm} 

  



\item[***] For the next two subquestions, suppose the worker is considering one shot deviations when they slacked in the past (so are now being offered $w_L$ forever).


    \item  Consider two deviations: taking the job and exerting low effort and taking the job and exerting high effort. Argue either mathematically or verbally that one is a more attractive deviation.


  \vspace{6cm} 

  
\item Write down one inequality that captures when the worker has no incentive to make the more attractive deviation in the last subquestion. Make sure to simplify. When does it hold?


  \vspace{7cm} 
  


\item[***] For the next two subquestions, suppose the worker is considering one shot deviations when they never slacked in the past (so are currently being offered $w_H$ each period).

    
    \item Consider two deviations: taking the job and exerting low effort and not taking the job. Argue either mathematically or verbally that one is a more attractive deviation.


  \vspace{6cm} 
  

\item Write down one inequality that captures when the worker has no incentive to make the more attractive deviation in the last subquestion. Make sure to simplify.


  \vspace{8cm}
  



\item Using the inequality you just derived, find the firm's optimal choice of $w_H$ and profit.

\vspace{6cm}

    \item Suppose initially $\delta = 0.5, v=4, \bar u = 1, c=1$. Then, conditions change and $\delta = 0.5, v=7, \bar u = 4, c=1$. Explain what happens to profit and provide an economic example.

\section{Career Concerns}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
        \item There are two firms and one worker.
        \item The worker has a skill level $a$ that no one knows.
        \item However, everyone knows that skills are distributed uniformly between $[0,A]$. That is, $a\sim U[0,A]$
        \item The worker exerts unobserved, costly effort: $c(e)=e^2/2$
        \item Revenue is equal to effort plus skill: $y=e+a$
        \item The worker is hired and exerts effort in two periods.
        \item The worker is hired in each period by the firm that posts the highest wage, and if there is a tie they randomly pick a firm (Bertrand style)
        \item All outside options are 0.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the first-best level of effort for a single period? That is, the $e_{FB}$ that maximizes output less the cost of effort?

\vspace{7cm}

    \item How much effort will the worker exert in period 2? Justify your answer.


\vspace{6cm}


    \item Denote the effort the firm believes the worker exerts in period 1 $\tilde e_1$. How can the firm recover the worker's skill using $\tilde e_1$ and output $y_1$?

\vspace{6cm}


    \item What output levels $y_1$ will the firm never observe if the worker does the effort that is expected ($\tilde e_1$)?

\vspace{7cm}


    \item Suppose the firms believe skill is $a$ in period 2. What wage will they bid in period 2? Justify your answer.


\vspace{7cm}



    \item Solve for the worker's optimal effort.


\vspace{6cm}


    \item What wage do the firms in period 1 bid? Justify your answer.


\vspace{6cm}


\item How does this effort compare to the effort in sub question 1? Why is the worker working hard?

\vspace{5cm}

    \item Suppose $A=20$. If a worker has skill $12$, how does their wage change from period 1 to period 2?
